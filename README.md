# Amazon ML Challenge 2024 - Image Classification with LightGBM

This repository contains the code and workflow used for the Amazon ML Challenge 2024. The project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline that handles large datasets, extracts features from images using deep learning models, and trains a LightGBM model to predict entity values based on extracted features.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do so using `pip`:

```bash
pip install boto3 tensorflow lightgbm scikit-learn requests pandas tqdm s3fs
```

## Data Analysis

This section involves loading the dataset and performing basic data analysis. The dataset contains images and associated metadata. We check for missing values and understand the distribution of the data.

```python
from google.colab import drive
import pandas as pd

# Mount the Google Drive to access the dataset
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Load train and test datasets
train_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/amazon/dataset/test.csv")
test_df = pd.read_csv("/content/drive/MyDrive/amazon/dataset/train.csv")

# Data Inspection
print(train_df.head())
print(test_df.head())

# Check for missing values
print(train_df.isnull().sum())
print(test_df.isnull().sum())

# Entity Name distribution
print(train_df["entity_name"].value_counts())
```

## Data Preprocessing

Since the dataset contains large image files, images are stored in AWS S3. This section handles the downloading and uploading of images to S3.

```python
import boto3
import requests
import os
from tqdm import tqdm

# Initialize S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='Your-access', aws_secret_access_key='Your-secret access')

bucket_name = 'Your-bucket-name'

# Create directory for images
if not os.path.exists('train_images'):
    os.makedirs('train_images')

# Load train.csv from S3
train_df = pd.read_csv(f's3://{bucket_name}/train.csv')

# Download and upload images to S3
for idx, row in tqdm(train_df.iterrows(), total=len(train_df)):
    img_url = row['image_link']
    img_name = f"train_images/{row['group_id']}_{idx}.jpg"
    try:
        # Download image
        img_data = requests.get(img_url).content

        # Save locally
        with open(img_name, 'wb') as handler:
            handler.write(img_data)

        # Upload to S3
        s3.upload_file(img_name, bucket_name, img_name)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error downloading {img_url}: {e}")
```

## Feature Extraction

This section uses the ResNet50 pre-trained model to extract features from images.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model

# Load ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Add pooling layer for feature extraction
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(base_model.output)
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=x)

# Extract features for images stored in S3
def load_image_from_s3(image_path, target_size=(224, 224)):
    img_obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=image_path)
    img = load_img(BytesIO(img_obj['Body'].read()), target_size=target_size)
    img_array = img_to_array(img) / 255.0  # Normalize
    return img_array

# Extract features for all images
train_images = prepare_images(image_paths)
image_features = model.predict(train_images)
```

## Batch Processing & Feature Storage

Handling large datasets by processing images in batches to extract features efficiently.

```python
import time

def process_images_in_batches(image_paths, batch_size=32):
    features = []
    start_time = time.time()

    for batch_start in range(0, len(image_paths), batch_size):
        batch_paths = image_paths[batch_start:batch_start + batch_size]
        batch_images = prepare_images(batch_paths)
        if batch_images:
            batch_features = model.predict(batch_images)
            features.append(batch_features)

    end_time = time.time()
    print(f"Total processing time: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
    return np.vstack(features)

# Process images in batches
train_images = process_images_in_batches(image_paths)
```

## Model Training

Train a LightGBM model using the extracted image features to map them to entity values.

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into training and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(image_features, train_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train LightGBM model
train_data = lgb.Dataset(X_train, label=y_train)
val_data = lgb.Dataset(X_val, label=y_val, reference=train_data)

params = {'objective': 'regression', 'metric': 'l2', 'boosting_type': 'gbdt'}
gbm = lgb.train(params, train_data, valid_sets=[val_data], num_boost_round=100)
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model using F1 score and accuracy.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, accuracy_score

y_pred = gbm.predict(X_val, num_iteration=gbm.best_iteration)

# Evaluate F1 score
f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred, average='macro')
print(f"F1 Score: {f1}")

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

## Prediction & Output

Generate predictions on the test data and save the results.

```python
# Prepare test data and make predictions
test_image_features = model.predict(test_images)
predictions = gbm.predict(test_image_features)

# Save predictions to CSV
output_df = pd.DataFrame({'index': test_df['index'], 'prediction': predictions})
output_df.to_csv('predictions.csv', index=False)

# Optionally upload the predictions CSV to S3
s3.upload_file('predictions.csv', bucket_name, 'predictions.csv')
```
